## El reto
Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The only JavaScript required is for switching the slides.

Your users should be able to:
- **View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size**
- **Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard *(keyboard aun no implementado)***
